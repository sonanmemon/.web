excerpt: 'Machine   Learning   (henceforth   ML)   refers   to   the   set   of   algorithms   and computational  methods  which  enable  computers  to  learn  patterns  from  training  data without being  explicitly  programmed  to  do  so. ML  uses training  data to  learn  patterns by  estimating  a  mathematical  model  and  making  predictions  in out  of  sample based  on new or unseen input data. ML has the tremendous capacity to discover complex, flexible and crucially generalisable structure in training data. Conceptually speaking, ML can be thought of as a set of complex function approximation techniques which help us learn the unknown  and  potentially  highly  nonlinear  mapping  between  the  data  and  prediction outcomes, outperforming traditional techniques.'
