👋! I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 

I have a MPhil 🎓 in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc 🎓 in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS (Lahore), Pakistan.

🔬 My research interests lie in the following areas: empirical macroeconomics with an emphasis of monetary policy transmission and the intersection of network science and macroeconomics.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, Bayesian VARS and local projections to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy 🏦 in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission depends on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status, degree of fiscal conservatism of the incumbent government, exchange rate regimes and degree of financial inclusion in response to various local and international shocks.

Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of macroeconomics and networks, mainly through the lens 🔎 of understanding the structure of the international monetary system. For instance, during my MPhil thesis at Oxford, I worked on extending a New Keynesian model to incorporate an endogenous, inflation expectation formation process based on social learning and herding among consumers 👬. Understanding such information spillovers is crucial for estimating monetary policy transmission, which depends on anchoring of expectations and expected path of future inflation. In In similar vein, I am interested in how the political economy of money functions through linkages across international private banks and state/central bank networks, where the central node is the US dollar 💸 + Federal Reserve System. This network structure determines the global coordination of monetary policy and management of global business cycle dynamics.

I am proficient in applied econometric tools including machine learning and solving small DSGE models using DYNARE and IRIS-Toolbox. I can also code in R, Julia, MATLAB, Python, and STATA with advanced proficiency for all but Python.
