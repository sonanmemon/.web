ðŸ‘‹! I am a PhD Economics Student at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. 



# Background:


I have a MPhil ðŸŽ“ in Economics from the University of Oxford, UK and a BSc ðŸŽ“ in Economics and Mathematics from LUMS, Pakistan.

I have studied and lived in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore and Islamabad in Pakistan. I worked in IBA, Karachi as a Lecturer of Economics during 2020-2021 and at PIDE, Islamabad as a research fellow during 2021-2024.

# Research Interests ðŸ”¬:

My research interests lie in the following areas: 

âžœ Estimating monetary policy transmission effects using exogenous or identified macroeconomic shocks in time series and panel data settings.

âžœ Understanding the international monetary system and policy through the network structure of private banks, central/state banks and consumer sentiment across the globe.

âžœ Monetary policy in the age of cryptocurrencies and state bank issued digital currencies.

Firstly, I use empirical macroeconomic tools such as reduced form VARs, structural VARs, bayesian VARS, local projections and dynamic panel models to estimate the transmission channels of monetary policy in both advanced and emerging economies. I have worked on papers which measure how monetary transmission effects vary based on the degree of central bank independence, inflation targeting regime status, degree of fiscal conservatism of the incumbent government, exchange rate regimes and degree of financial inclusion in response to various local and international shocks.

Secondly, I am interested in the intersection of monetary economics and networks, by inspecting the network structure of international monetary system with respect to consumer expectations and global financial system. For instance, during my MPhil thesis at Oxford, I worked on extending a New Keynesian model to incorporate an inflation expectation formation process driven by social learning and herding of beliefs among consumers. In similar vein, I am fascinated about the structure of international and intra-national links across private banks and networks among central/federal banks of various nations, where the central nodes are large American banks and the US Federal Reserve System. Such network structures play a key role in the generation as well as amplification of global financial shocks. Hence, understanding this system is critical for effective global coordination of monetary policies for the management of global business cycle fluctuations.

I am also interested in optimal monetary policy design in the age of digital currencies such as cryptocurrencies and state-bank issued digital currencies. 

# Research Skills:

âžœ I am proficient in many applied macro-econometrics/empirical macroeconomic models including machine learning methods.

âžœ I can build, solve and calibrate small DSGE models using MATLAB, DYNARE and IRIS-Toolbox. 

âžœ I can also code in R, Julia, Python, and STATA environments with advanced proficiency in R and Julia.
